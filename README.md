# Scheduling Algorithms

## About this Repository

This repository contains the code for a school project in my **Operating Systems** class.

## About the Project

The requirements for the project are as follows:

**Objectives:**

- To simulate and visualize various CPU scheduling algorithms.
- To compare the performance of different algorithms based on metrics such as turnaround time, waiting
  time, and response time.

**Scheduling Algorithms to Implement:**

1. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
2. Shortest Process Next (SPN)
3. Shortest Remaining Time (SRT)
4. Round Robin (RR)
5. Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive)

**Features:**

- User Input: Allow users to input process details (e.g., process ID, arrival time, burst time, priority).
- Algorithm Selection: Let users choose which scheduling algorithm to simulate.
- Visualization: Create a graphical representation of the scheduling process, such as Gantt charts.
- Metrics Calculation: Automatically calculate and display key performance metrics (average waiting time, average turnaround time, and response time).
  **Tools and Technologies:**
  â€¢ Programming Language: `Python`, `Java`, or `C++`

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Input: Use command line arguments or prompt the user for input.
2. Implement the Algorithms: Write functions for each scheduling algorithm.
3. Output: Create a function to draw Gantt charts based on the scheduling order.
4. Calculate Metrics: Implement functions to compute average waiting time, turnaround time, and
   response time.
5. Testing and Validation: Test with various sets of process data to validate accuracy.

**Deliverables:**

- Single compressed file containing your source code and presentation/report.
